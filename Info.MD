## Inspiration

Ballroom dance championships opens are super fun, but to host a dance championships is a lot of work! Dancers affiliated with studios need to register but right now there's not a good payment vendor or software solution to do registrations online.

**Pay 2 Dance** attempts to solve that problem by using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) as a payment vendor that allows you to accept debit card, credit cards, amex all at a flat **2.9% plus 30 cents**

It also will send an email receipt to the dancers email address for record.

All the information is stored in secured way through Stripe!

On the stripe admin dashboard, you should be able to see all the registration details.

## Is this [PCI Compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) ?

Absolutely!

The website is hosted on a secure channel and payment information is not stored anywhere except for the Stripe hosted input box that millions of users use and trust all around the world. Stripe's standard security practices can be found [here](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe)!
